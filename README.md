# Decription
This is the final version of the workout tracker. The user will be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. When they log multiple exercises on a given day, they can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. If the workout is cardio, they will be able to track the distance traveled.
